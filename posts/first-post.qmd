## Summary

This week I learend how to better use git for academic use and to set up a quarto portfolio website on guthub pages. Additionally, I will be working on lab 1 where we will be setting up and programming our FPcdGA and MCU to run a simple task. 

## Reflections on Lab

I have yet to complete lab one but have made significant progress... Learning git was slow at first but I am excited for the functionality it can provide my academic and everyday life!
