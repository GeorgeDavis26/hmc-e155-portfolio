## Summary

	I created a custom Low-pass ladder filter to meet the following requirements:

* Designed for a source impedance and load impedance of 50Î©
* Pass band edge of 100MHz
* Stop band start of 200MHz
* 20dB of rejection in the stop band
* Insertion loss of less than 3dB
* In-band ripple of less than 1dB

	It was required to design the filter by hand before using any simulation or online calculator to verify the s-parameter results. See the report attached to get a better understanding of the details of the design and results.
