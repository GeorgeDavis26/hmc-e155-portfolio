## Summary

I developed an RF receiver to intercept and decode messages sent from a transmitter at 2.256 GHz. Please see the attached report to get an in-depth understanding of our receiver stages and calculations to support the results found. This was one of the most rewarding projects I have undertaken, as it was likely the best instance of me learning a completely foreign subject, such as radio communication, which is so deeply ingrained in my day-to-day life. The satisfaction of decoding the relatively simple message was brought to me by the culmination of a long and hard semester of work and theoretical understanding.
