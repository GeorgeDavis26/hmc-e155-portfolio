## Summary

Harvey Muddâ€™s primary group-based lab class teaches skills in communication and team dynamics through stressful and high-intensity scenarios, working through the development of our autonomous underwater robot. My role in the group focused primarily on the analog circuitry and control systems of our robot. I designed and implemented both the depth sensor and turbidity meter, and developed the Arduino code that controlled the motors using a digital proportional (P-control) feedback system based on the depth sensor readings. The following year, I joined the teaching team for this course, leading office hours outside of class time and providing support to the students during a dedicated lab shift.
