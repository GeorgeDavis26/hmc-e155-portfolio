In his free time, George loves to play the drums, go on hikes, and spend time with his friends in anyway possible. His interest in engineering started with robotics but now with what he has learned at HMC he has the skills to apply himself to many different subjects!"

Additionally, I wrote code to display the functionality of 3 SMT LEDs and a seven segment display using the breadboard adapter. My design met all requirements and I am excited to move on to the next lab!\nI spent 25 hours on this lab\nI would recommend addressing the ribbon cable shortage issue as soon as possible. I was noticing many unnecessary errrors arose from not having the propper wiring or broken jumpers between the ribbon cable female headers."
