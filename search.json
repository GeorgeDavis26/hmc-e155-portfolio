    "text": "This week the fourth micro-ps lab was due! It took a lot of effort because it was in a language I was less familiar with (C) and required reading the lengthy STM reference manual. I completed the lab and achieved the excellent spec which I was very happy with!\nWith these digital systems it can be very very demoralizing to debug because often the system will be completely broken with a simple misplaced bit. I find that with analog electrical systems often he circuit will at least work somewhat and you can use your intuition to decipher probable causes and get a starting point. I wasted so much time on this lab reading and rereading through my code when I was simply connected to the wrong physical pin on the dev board. However in my desperation to complete the lab I really reinforced my understanding of the system I deployed while I was searching for a bug in my code that didn’t exist.\nOutside of micro-ps my clinic project is continuing on, leading the team is proving to be a lot of work but still is coming out to be a rewarding experience! I am looking forward to making it through this semester and looking back on this tough work with pride."

    "text": "This week, the second micro-ps lab came and went, and with it was my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. In order to keep up, I needed to code my lab asynchronously from the hum of campus life. I found it difficult to find time when I was home and at the wedding to focus on my work. Part of this was because I was excited to spend time with my brother and sister in law, who were visiting from Dunedin, New Zealand, but also because I am beginning to notice that I thrive off of others who are dedicated to working on the same difficult and intense lab work. I came out of the weekend with fully written Verilog modules and testbenches, but hadn’t pushed anything to synthesis or a waveform generator/ simulator. Come Monday, I had to build my circuit and attempt to compile my code. Unfortunately, as a result, I ran out of time and wasn’t able to get my testbenches working in time for my lab checkoff. Therefore, I had to settle for proficiency for this lab. I plan to resubmit for excellence, but need to focus on lab 3 at the moment, since, as I have heard, it is one of the most difficult labs. Thankfully, class lecture this week focused on test benches, and I imagine the testing scheme that I make will lab 3 will be very similar yet more complex when compared to lab 2. So I am hoping, once I get lab 3 complete to the Excellence specification, going back and finishing up lab two will be a breeze.\nOutside of my micro-ps coursework, I have picked up a new humanities elective focused on public speaking. I am not a very good public speaker, and I think this opportunity will be good for me to improve these skills. I think there is a lot of value in being able to verbally communicate topics in nearly every scenario I see myself going. Additionally, I know it’s probably my biggest weakness at the moment. I think this will help me with job interviews, presentations, and my day-to-day conversations. I am nervous but excited. The nice thing about micro-ps is that there isn’t much else that is more difficult than it, so comparatively, everything is easy!"

    "text": "Reflection\nThe AI prototype was synthesized in the Lattice Radiant Software with minimal warnings. In general, I was impressed with ChatGPT’s code. I can’t be certain that the code works until I run a sim or verify the functionality on a working physical FPGA, but by inspection, it seems to function. However, with my relatively experienced knowledge base of System Verilog and FPGAs, the code used syntax and keywords that I was not used to. I think if I were to use this code to perform the function of my lab, I would not be able to debug as rapidly as I did with my own code. A HUGE benefit of writing your own code in digital design is being able to discern between a software and a hardware issue. If I didn’t write the code myself, I would likely waste a lot more time debugging. This is only true in my era of limited experience. I can imagine a hardware engineering pro with years of experience could understand and absorb the code the LLM gave very quickly to the point where they would understand it like their own. To some extent, it’s like a junior developer wrote code for you. Those skills exist in the world, but they are hard fought, and I am not there yet!\nA piece of syntax that ChatGPT used that I am unfamiliar with came in its instantiation of TICKS_PER_TOGGLE, where it defined a “localparam int unsigned”. I could make a guess at what this is, but really have no idea what it means to the level that is necessary to be able to interact with it once an issue inevitably comes up. What I have gathered from this class thus far is that NOTHING works on the first try, and problem-solving is almost necessary. If I can’t understand the code, it is useless.\nAfter I uploaded my own sv files, the code the LLM produced was much more understandable. If I enter the industry or ever have an ambitious personal project, I think this is the best method to make sure the LLM gives me something I can understand and not reference some decade-old old stackoverflow code from a senior engineer."

    "text": "Comparing the Performance of Interrupts and Polling Based Code\nInterrupts, when triggered and configured in their proper handler will halt any processes in the core and perform their function. This is convenient for when you are either waiting for something to happen or need to designate a set amount of time before something happens and you want to complete other tasks while you are waiting. If our code was any longer than the period of the input signal itself the polling method would not be able to keep up. For example a printf statement, a rather slow operation, could cause the poll to miss an edge on a high frequency stimulus. But an interrupt based implementation would have the edge detection running in the background and be able to halt other processes to perform the function in near real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrupt output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\nPolling output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\n\n\n\nWith no delay the output traces of either of the polling or interrupt approaches are very similar. There is little difference in the delay between the input signal and the output signal in either example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrupt output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\nPolling output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\n\n\n\nWith a 20 ms delay representative of some slow coding process the polling method absolutely falls apart as the signal is alliased beyond recognition. The polling code needs to wait for the timer to be done to detect an edge while the interupt can break the sequence of events of whatever is happening and “steal” the memory stack pointer to output on the GPIO.\n\nIn this picture I measured the polling output (blue) and the interrupt output (yellow) both set to trigger at the edges of the same quadrature pin. There is a 34 µs delay between the two but this is not a fair comparison. The interrupt hogs the memory pointer when an edge is detected and doesn’t allow for the poll to detect the edge itself until it is done output to the GPIO. In order to prove that the interrupt was a better implementation I had to set up two independent tests like I did above. However, this concept is why the interrupts are better for quick stimuli."

I’m using the STM32L432KC, what pins should I connect the encoder to in order to allow it to easily trigger the interrupts?\nChatGPT walked me through MOST of the top down process of at least setting up my project, but still was missing many of the pieces of a fully functional segger project. It started by explaining the concept of a quadrature encoder and how the idea of an interrupt fits into its function. Then it moved to which pins to use; here was where my first warning flag went off. I wish it would have asked me clarifying questions so I could specify that we were using a 5V input and would need to take that into consideration to the pin selection. Next, it moved to the implementation of the actual interrupt handling. It gave me a HAL-based implementation (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in the following line:\n__HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE();\nWe have not covered this tool in class. Upon prompting Chat again about what it was, it explained that it was a macro that handled the initialization of the GPIOA pins. This is helpful, and maybe I could have inferred this from the words contained in the macro, but to an ignorant or inexperienced user, this is a black box that could introduce hard-to-handle code bugs.\nThe LLM then went and explained how to handle the encoder logic to determine the direction of the motor. I had a very similar approach to what ChatGPT recommended, but I don’t think I would have understood its implementation without working through it myself. The LLM also suggested I use a set of timers to decode the angular velocity. I was unaware of this functionality, but I think this is one of the positives of using the LLMS for something like this. It can pick out things from the reference manual (alternative functions) that I missed on initial scans of the document !"

Most of my time was spent on debugging my code while overlooking that I was reading out of the wrong pin on the oscilloscope and on my timer. This is because the pin names on the STM dev board do not match the pin names in software (i.e., A6 != PA6)"

    "text": "This week I completed my first micro-ps lab! This was very satisfying but difficult. I needed to brush off my surface-mount soldering and System Verilog skills quickly in order to meet the fast-approaching deadline. This was my first time using the Upduino FPGA board and the Lattice Radiant programmer to complete any task. There is always a learning curve with new software, but as I gain more experience in the computer engineering field, the curve steepens and my ability to learn quickly increases.\nLooking past micro-ps, this was the first week of my senior year! I have set a goal for myself to apply for at least one job per day to give myself the best possible chances of landing something I am both passionate about and in the location I want, the Bay Area. I would be very happy to work at a company that requires me to do some HDL programming or stress the skills learned in E155. This week, I am going back home to attend my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. I have installed the Fusion Virtual Machine to be able to use the Lattice Radiant and Questa software for the upcoming lab. This will be a challenge, but I am confident that I am up to the task!"
