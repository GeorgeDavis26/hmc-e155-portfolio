    "text": "This week, the second micro-ps lab came and went, and with it was my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. In order to keep up, I needed to code my lab asynchronously from the hum of campus life. I found it difficult to find time when I was home and at the wedding to focus on my work. Part of this was because I was excited to spend time with my brother and sister in law, who were visiting from Dunedin, New Zealand, but also because I am beginning to notice that I thrive off of others who are dedicated to working on the same difficult and intense lab work. I came out of the weekend with fully written Verilog modules and testbenches, but hadn’t pushed anything to synthesis or a waveform generator/ simulator. Come Monday, I had to build my circuit and attempt to compile my code. Unfortunately, as a result, I ran out of time and wasn’t able to get my testbenches working in time for my lab checkoff. Therefore, I had to settle for proficiency for this lab. I plan to resubmit for excellence, but need to focus on lab 3 at the moment, since, as I have heard, it is one of the most difficult labs. Thankfully, class lecture this week focused on test benches, and I imagine the testing scheme that I make will lab 3 will be very similar yet more complex when compared to lab 2. So I am hoping, once I get lab 3 complete to the Excellence specification, going back and finishing up lab two will be a breeze.\nOutside of my micro-ps coursework, I have picked up a new humanities elective focused on public speaking. I am not a very good public speaker, and I think this opportunity will be good for me to improve these skills. I think there is a lot of value in being able to verbally communicate topics in nearly every scenario I see myself going. Additionally, I know it’s probably my biggest weakness at the moment. I think this will help me with job interviews, presentations, and my day-to-day conversations. I am nervous but excited. The nice thing about micro-ps is that there isn’t much else that is more difficult than it, so comparatively, everything is easy!"

    "text": "Reflect\nThe AI prototype was synthesized in the Lattice Radiant Software with minimal warnings. In general, I was impressed with ChatGPT’s code. I can’t be certain that the code works until I run a sim or verify the functionality on a working physical FPGA, but by inspection, it seems to function. However, with my relatively experienced knowledge base of System Verilog and FPGAs, the code used syntax and keywords that I was not used to. I think if I were to use this code to perform the function of my lab, I would not be able to debug as rapidly as I did with my own code. A HUGE benefit of writing your own code in digital design is being able to discern between a software and a hardware issue. If I didn’t write the code myself, I would likely waste a lot more time debugging. This is only true in my era of limited experience. I can imagine a hardware engineering pro with years of experience could understand and absorb the code the LLM gave very quickly to the point where they would understand it like their own. To some extent, it’s like a junior developer wrote code for you. Those skills exist in the world, but they are hard fought, and I am not there yet!\nA piece of syntax that ChatGPT used that I am unfamiliar with came in its instantiation of TICKS_PER_TOGGLE, where it defined a “localparam int unsigned”. I could make a guess at what this is, but really have no idea what it means to the level that is necessary to be able to interact with it once an issue inevitably comes up. What I have gathered from this class thus far is that NOTHING works on the first try, and problem-solving is almost necessary. If I can’t understand the code, it is useless.\nAfter I uploaded my own sv files, the code the LLM produced was much more understandable. If I enter the industry or ever have an ambitious personal project, I think this is the best method to make sure the LLM gives me something I can understand and not reference some decade-old old stackoverflow code from a senior engineer."

    "text": "Lab 4 focused on setting up drivers for the STM32L432KB to configure two timers to execute a simple song on an 8-ohm speaker. To do this, I created a simple audio amplifying circuit with an LM386 with a gain of 50, along with a series of custom and provided drivers and C functions. The code converted an array of pitches and durations to timer frequencies that divided down the configured system clock to toggle a GPIO pin. This lab was difficult because I had to make my own timer divers and initialize them to the correct modes. To do this, I had to decipher the hard-to-read data sheet and cross-reference multiple sections to enable the proper bits. This had an extremely steep learning curve, but I feel very confident with it now. My design meets the excellent requirements of the class.\nI spent 30 hours on this lab. Most of my time was spent on debugging my code while overlooking that I was reading out of the wrong pin on the oscilloscope and on my timer. This is because the pin names on the STM dev board do not match the pin names in software (i.e., A6 != PA6)"

    "text": "This week I completed my first micro-ps lab! This was very satisfying but difficult. I needed to brush off my surface-mount soldering and System Verilog skills quickly in order to meet the fast-approaching deadline. This was my first time using the Upduino FPGA board and the Lattice Radiant programmer to complete any task. There is always a learning curve with new software, but as I gain more experience in the computer engineering field, the curve steepens and my ability to learn quickly increases.\nLooking past micro-ps, this was the first week of my senior year! I have set a goal for myself to apply for at least one job per day to give myself the best possible chances of landing something I am both passionate about and in the location I want, the Bay Area. I would be very happy to work at a company that requires me to do some HDL programming or stress the skills learned in E155. This week, I am going back home to attend my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. I have installed the Fusion Virtual Machine to be able to use the Lattice Radiant and Questa software for the upcoming lab. This will be a challenge, but I am confident that I am up to the task!"
