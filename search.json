    "text": "This week I completed my first micro-ps lab! This was very satisfying but difficult. I needed to brush off my surface-mount soldering and System Verilog skills quickly in order to meet the fast-approaching deadline. This was my first time using the Upduino FPGA board and the Lattice Radiant programmer to complete any task. There is always a learning curve with new software, but as I gain more experience in the computer engineering field, the curve steepens and my ability to learn quickly increases.\nLooking past micro-ps, this was the first week of my senior year! I have set a goal for myself to apply for at least one job per day to give myself the best possible chances of landing something I am both passionate about and in the location I want, the Bay Area. I would be very happy to work at a company that requires me to do some HDL programming or stress the skills learned in E155. This week, I am going back home to attend my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. I have installed the Fusion Virtual Machine to be able to use the Lattice Radiant and Questa software for the upcoming lab. This will be a challenge, but I am confident that I am up to the task!"

    "title": "Visual Displays of Information",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This week in SOSC 150 - Public Speaking, we focused on presenting information visually through slideshow presentations and graphics. The general concepts learned were based on Edward R. Tufte’s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and its main points of graphic design philosophy. These points boiled down to the idea of conserving your ink for strictly important data and information and doing your best to avoid any flavorful designs in the margins of your slides and graphics. The three in-class activities were all related together and prioritized us students improving our visual communication skills. First, we identified three outstanding charts, graphics, or diagrams in our respective fields to be brought to class and analyzed. Second, we worked with a partner to generate three graphs of our own using data from the United Nations census and what we had learned in the class prior. Finally, we brought an improved slide from one of the presentations that we had given at some point earlier in our academic careers.\nIn my opinion, decisions relating to what to include and not include on a slide are much more ambiguous than a plot. However, it is important to keep in mind that a bad instance of either can be detrimental to your argument or proposal. I learned that first and foremost, graphic presentations should always be as simple as possible while still being able to convey the information properly. This is of course, has its boundaries; a bare plot with few axis labels, and just a point of data would be taking this too far. One needs to take deep care into whether or not the various communication tools that clutter a plot are strictly necessary, but not be afraid to use them. A good example of this would be grid lines and ticks. In the incorrect application, these would be wasted, but they can be beneficial. These decisions are nuanced, and it can be helpful to generate multiple iterations of the same plot to make sure you get to the best final product possible.\nFinally, I would like to briefly mention the first talk that I attended for credit this semester. It was titled “Dangerous Questions” and was held by 6 HMC HSA faculty members, who all presented short independent talks on the current administration and the authoritarian times they lived in. Some of the speakers chose to use slides, and others didn’t. I found Prof. Dadabhoy’s and Prof. Mayeri’s talks both very different but equally impactful. Dadabhoy recited a rehearsed speech that she made engaging by interviewing it with a well-known concept, Shakespeare. Mayeri used visual art to make her argument. Both were different and impactful!"

    "title": "Debate on Speech",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This week, I had my debate where I opposed the notion of allowing for academic institutions to restrict patently offensive speech. I crafted my argument with my debate partner, Jacob Sesate, in two meetings prior to our debate. We coupled online research with our own logic and moral compass to guide our argument. This was partially difficult because we were slightly uncomfortable with some parts of our argument. I personally think that there should not be institution-level restrictions on speech, but there should exist social repercussions based on definitions placed by the student body. I think this is something that the honor board and the honor code accomplish well. My appreciation for what the honor code is grew during my research. Our primary argument was based on the fact that, as long as a student doesn’t threaten violence, speech should not be restricted because those bad sentiments need to be addressed and squashed before the individual enters the real world. Academic institutions are places of learning, and disallowing a student to make a mistake does not solve the issue; instead, it compresses the issue and forces the individual to resort to internet echo chambers.\nUnfortunately, my partner missed the debate itself due to sickness, so I had to present our points all by myself. While this was stressful, I handled myself well, and upon my reflection, it felt as if it made aspects of the debate easier. For example, I didn’t have to consider another person’s opinions when voicing my responses to questions. There were undoubtedly some things we didn’t completely agree on, and avoiding that was easy if it was only me presenting the points. I think my argument was much more congruent because it wasn’t split between two minds. In the future, I could come more prepared to the question and answer portion of these debates. I had a few drawn up before the debate, but when I got the opportunity to ask them, they felt weak. This is where having another person could have been helpful. I found the most impactful questions related to the content of their opening remarks. If I had another set of ears, I could confirm things that I didn’t completely remember them saying.\nOne piece of advice I received from the professor was to try to limit my physical tics, which are a partial product of my nervousness. This is going to be difficult for me to address because it is not a part of my conscience mind. I did feel improvements from my values talk in this department, because while I was moving uncontrollably, I didn’t feel nervous. I came well prepared and was confident in my position, which helped a lot!"

    "title": "Fundamentals of Public Speaking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I enrolled late to SOSC 150 so this was my first week in the Public Speaking course. I gave myself the week to listen and learn from the other students to see what was expected from the talks. My scheduled “Values” talk is next Monday, and with what I have taken from this week, I think I am well prepared to do a good job. In this short reflection, I would like to walk through the things I noticed in the other students’ talks and how I will apply them to my own talk next week. First, I learned how the use of your inanimate objects, such as paper or digital notes, can affect a listener’s attentiveness. Second, your own perceived interest in the topic you are discussing does well to draw the audience in. Finally, data to back claims up, live, bolsters your argument and will make your speech more impactful.\nStarting with note devices, I watched as some of my classmates used their notes as a sort of escape from the pressure of the eyes of the audience. On the other hand, some of my classmates only glanced at their notes when they were reciting something word-for-word or at some transition point of their speech. In essence, it was candid and natural. I tend to be slightly nervous in public speaking environments, so I will have to be wary not to fall into the trap that my peers did. One naunce that allows for a more forgiving dependence on notes is using paper notes as opposed to digital notes on a phone or tablet.\nNow moving to the idea that the audience’s perception of your interest in the subject of your talk does well for their own interest. One thing Prof. Steinberg continually mentioned was that the audience will follow your lead on their opinions of your talk. If you are happy, they will be happy; if you are confident, they will be confident in your words, and unless you admit or apologize for a mistake, they probably will not notice. Some of my classmates targeted this strategy by choosing topics that they were uniquely invested in. I recall a classmate speaking about contact football in younger age groups being a positive thing. This was especially impactful to me in the audience because he explained how he played football at a young age, as had many past generations of his family. With that, I started drafting my talk based on subjects that were sourced from my own personal gripes with life. We will see where I land, but with what I have at the moment, I feel very passionate about my topics.\nFinally, whenever one of my classmates had some auxiliary facts to support their claims or a prop to hand out to the audience, if done right, I was more willing to listen to what they were arguing. Even if I did not explicitly agree with their claim, starting from a fact and then hearing their point of view in relation to that fact was helpful to understand the basis of their claim and maybe allow me to form a more charitable interpretation of their argument."

    "text": "Reflection\nThe AI prototype was synthesized in the Lattice Radiant Software with minimal warnings. In general, I was impressed with ChatGPT’s code. I can’t be certain that the code works until I run a sim or verify the functionality on a working physical FPGA, but by inspection, it seems to function. However, with my relatively experienced knowledge base of System Verilog and FPGAs, the code used syntax and keywords that I was not used to. I think if I were to use this code to perform the function of my lab, I would not be able to debug as rapidly as I did with my own code. A HUGE benefit of writing your own code in digital design is being able to discern between a software and a hardware issue. If I didn’t write the code myself, I would likely waste a lot more time debugging. This is only true in my era of limited experience. I can imagine a hardware engineering pro with years of experience could understand and absorb the code the LLM gave very quickly to the point where they would understand it like their own. To some extent, it’s like a junior developer wrote code for you. Those skills exist in the world, but they are hard fought, and I am not there yet!\nA piece of syntax that ChatGPT used that I am unfamiliar with came in its instantiation of TICKS_PER_TOGGLE, where it defined a “localparam int unsigned”. I could make a guess at what this is, but really have no idea what it means to the level that is necessary to be able to interact with it once an issue inevitably comes up. What I have gathered from this class thus far is that NOTHING works on the first try, and problem-solving is almost necessary. If I can’t understand the code, it is useless.\nAfter I uploaded my own sv files, the code the LLM produced was much more understandable. If I enter the industry or ever have an ambitious personal project, I think this is the best method to make sure the LLM gives me something I can understand and not reference some decade-old old stackoverflow code from a senior engineer."

    "text": "Comparing the Performance of Interrupts and Polling Based Code\nInterrupts, when triggered and configured in their proper handler will halt any processes in the core and perform their function. This is convenient for when you are either waiting for something to happen or need to designate a set amount of time before something happens and you want to complete other tasks while you are waiting. If our code was any longer than the period of the input signal itself the polling method would not be able to keep up. For example a printf statement, a rather slow operation, could cause the poll to miss an edge on a high frequency stimulus. But an interrupt based implementation would have the edge detection running in the background and be able to halt other processes to perform the function in near real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrupt output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\nPolling output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\n\n\n\nWith no delay the output traces of either of the polling or interrupt approaches are very similar. There is little difference in the delay between the input signal and the output signal in either example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrupt output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\nPolling output pin (blue) Input Quadrature pin (yellow)\n\n\n\nWith a 20 ms delay representative of some slow coding process the polling method absolutely falls apart as the signal is alliased beyond recognition. The polling code needs to wait for the timer to be done to detect an edge while the interupt can break the sequence of events of whatever is happening and “steal” the memory stack pointer to output on the GPIO.\n\nIn this picture I measured the polling output (blue) and the interrupt output (yellow) both set to trigger at the edges of the same quadrature pin. There is a 34 µs delay between the two but this is not a fair comparison. The interrupt hogs the memory pointer when an edge is detected and doesn’t allow for the poll to detect the edge itself until it is done output to the GPIO. In order to prove that the interrupt was a better implementation I had to set up two independent tests like I did above. However, this concept is why the interrupts are better for quick stimuli."

I’m using the STM32L432KC, what pins should I connect the encoder to in order to allow it to easily trigger the interrupts?\nChatGPT walked me through MOST of the top down process of at least setting up my project, but still was missing many of the pieces of a fully functional segger project. It started by explaining the concept of a quadrature encoder and how the idea of an interrupt fits into its function. Then it moved to which pins to use; here was where my first warning flag went off. I wish it would have asked me clarifying questions so I could specify that we were using a 5V input and would need to take that into consideration to the pin selection. Next, it moved to the implementation of the actual interrupt handling. It gave me a HAL-based implementation (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in the following line:\n__HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE();\nWe have not covered this tool in class. Upon prompting Chat again about what it was, it explained that it was a macro that handled the initialization of the GPIOA pins. This is helpful, and maybe I could have inferred this from the words contained in the macro, but to an ignorant or inexperienced user, this is a black box that could introduce hard-to-handle code bugs.\nThe LLM then went and explained how to handle the encoder logic to determine the direction of the motor. I had a very similar approach to what ChatGPT recommended, but I don’t think I would have understood its implementation without working through it myself. The LLM also suggested I use a set of timers to decode the angular velocity. I was unaware of this functionality, but I think this is one of the positives of using the LLMS for something like this. It can pick out things from the reference manual (alternative functions) that I missed on initial scans of the document !"

    "text": "This week, the second micro-ps lab came and went, and with it was my cousin’s wedding in Walla Walla, Washington. In order to keep up, I needed to code my lab asynchronously from the hum of campus life. I found it difficult to find time when I was home and at the wedding to focus on my work. Part of this was because I was excited to spend time with my brother and sister in law, who were visiting from Dunedin, New Zealand, but also because I am beginning to notice that I thrive off of others who are dedicated to working on the same difficult and intense lab work. I came out of the weekend with fully written Verilog modules and testbenches, but hadn’t pushed anything to synthesis or a waveform generator/ simulator. Come Monday, I had to build my circuit and attempt to compile my code. Unfortunately, as a result, I ran out of time and wasn’t able to get my testbenches working in time for my lab checkoff. Therefore, I had to settle for proficiency for this lab. I plan to resubmit for excellence, but need to focus on lab 3 at the moment, since, as I have heard, it is one of the most difficult labs. Thankfully, class lecture this week focused on test benches, and I imagine the testing scheme that I make will lab 3 will be very similar yet more complex when compared to lab 2. So I am hoping, once I get lab 3 complete to the Excellence specification, going back and finishing up lab two will be a breeze.\nOutside of my micro-ps coursework, I have picked up a new humanities elective focused on public speaking. I am not a very good public speaker, and I think this opportunity will be good for me to improve these skills. I think there is a lot of value in being able to verbally communicate topics in nearly every scenario I see myself going. Additionally, I know it’s probably my biggest weakness at the moment. I think this will help me with job interviews, presentations, and my day-to-day conversations. I am nervous but excited. The nice thing about micro-ps is that there isn’t much else that is more difficult than it, so comparatively, everything is easy!"

    "text": "This week in Public Speaking, I gave an impromptu speech under the prompt “What advice would you give an incoming Harvey Mudd freshman. I had one minute to prepare a hurried idea or outline of what I was intending to present to the imaginary prospective freshman class. I think this talk went well, and aspects of my delivery, especially, were surprisingly better than my other, more structured and thought-out speeches. I think the prompt was much simpler and struck a topic that I was immediately well prepared for, as opposed to my other talks, which required me to stretch for outside information. I had the opportunity to speak after two of my other classmates, which complicated my approach because I had to make sure that I wouldn’t overlap with what they were saying. Thankfully, my planned approach was very different from the talks they gave. I chose to speak about the role of the freshman year and how it impacts the rest of your college experience, which then leads you to dedicate yourself to a siloed discipline for the foreseeable future. I felt confident about this talk because it was relevant to how I was presently dealing with the looming anxiety of post-graduate life. I quickly identified freshman year as the most formative of my 4 years here at Harvey Mudd, and therefore was why I chose to speak about freshman year being a “stepping stone” between your childhood and the rest of your life. With the circumstances of this talk, I needed to develop my speech as I was telling it. I think my planning was done well and set myself up for success as I decided where I wanted to start and end the speech. The feedback I received from the professor and the class primarily related to my analytical tone and the distraction that my phone posed as my notes device. I didn’t end up ever referencing my notes and could have easily left my phone aside. This was a product of the impromptu nature of the talk, and I think having the idea of the notes nearby gave me confidence to deliver a solid talk."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week I gave my first talk to the class! The subject of the talk was based on a set of my own personal values relating to any experience or widespread argument. I chose to speak about my belief that we as individuals are being forced to enter short-term and unnecessary financial agreements with corporations to chase a mirage of choice that we have identified to be present in upper-class circles. I was really excited about my topic because not only did I feel comfortable speaking on it, I felt it was a profound issue in our present society that was not spoken about all too often. I related my gripe to two main instances of these short term financial contracts present to any American consumer: subscription services and the option to finance single to double digit purchases over a few months. My main point was that while each of these financial tools may seem to allow the consumer more freedom they actually restrict your options and only give you the illusion of choice. For example within a subscription based streaming service maybe ten percent of the content is watchable while the rest is merely filler. With the deferred payment or financing tool you are signing away a portion of your income for the next few months to a small purchase. This stacked up over many purchases would be incredibly damaging to your financial consistency. One is incentivized to use this tool even though it places a long term financial burden on them because they desire to live above their means and experience something at a time of their choosing without thinking about the financial consequences as a rich person might.\nI found through giving my speech that my argument as explained above is much more clear and easy to understand in a written format and is weakened when I am asked to vocalize it. The main point of feedback I received that I need to incorporate in the future was that in order to make sure that your audience understands your argument at all points you need to reiterate the central thesis throughout the speech. Most of my formal argumentative analysis training has been through written essays or papers so this shift in structure is new to me. I am confident that I will be able to incorporate this feedback into my future talks as it is as simple as restating the thesis periodically after new information has been provided. The second piece of advice I received from the class and professor was that my nervousness was noticeable but only present in my shaking hands. This was a quick tell to my listeners that I was uncomfortable and anxious. I have found that when the speaker displays emotion the listeners will follow them. I will have to work out a way to stop my hands shaking, or at least make it less noticeable to mitigate this."

I find that with analog electrical systems often he circuit will at least work somewhat and you can use your intuition to decipher probable causes and get a starting point. I wasted so much time on this lab reading and rereading through my code when I was simply connected to the wrong physical pin on the dev board. However in my desperation to complete the lab I really reinforced my understanding of the system I deployed while I was searching for a bug in my code that didn’t exist.\nOutside of micro-ps my clinic project is continuing on, leading the team is proving to be a lot of work but still is coming out to be a rewarding experience!

Please see the attached report to get an in-depth understanding of our receiver stages and calculations to support the results found. This was one of the most rewarding projects I have undertaken, as it was likely the best instance of me learning a completely foreign subject, such as radio communication, which is so deeply ingrained in my day-to-day life. The satisfaction of decoding the relatively simple message was brought to me by the culmination of a long and hard semester of work and theoretical understanding."
